# AndroDash

## Synopsis
The AndroDash library provides an easy to use self-organizing dashboard layout for Android.

It can easily be used in any layout or by programmatically assembling a View.

## License
As usual with my libraries, the AndroDash library is published under a simplified 2-clause BSD license.

## Availability
The AndroDash library is available through it's [GitHub.com repository](https://github.com/dimensionv/androdash), and through the central maven repository at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Candrodash).

Simply add it as a dependency to your favorite build system / dependency management system, and you will be able to use it.

## Documentation
The library is documented using JavaDoc. I took great care to explain everything properly, but feel free send patches with improvements where you think it's appropriate. In case I agree and find the time, I will update the library.
Besides being available through the same channels as the library itself, you can also read it directly online via my [javadoc-repository](http://javadoc.dimensionv.de/androdash/).

For more information, you can also look at the [project website](http://dimensionv.github.io/androdash/) at github.io.

## Known Issues
Currently there are no issues.

* fix them and send the patches
